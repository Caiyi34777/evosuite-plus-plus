HOW TO PACKAGE EVOSUITE JARS FOR USE?
After importing evosuite modules, below launches will be found under Run --> Run Configuration --> Maven Build

Build with this order:
	+ evosuite-client build
	+ evosuite clean install skip test
	+ evosuite generate jars

Evosuite jars can be found in folder evosuite/generated-jars

If you encounter any strange error after running maven, try to run "evosuite clean install skip test", 
and then Project --> Clean, then refresh all projects.
