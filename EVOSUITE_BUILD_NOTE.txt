HOW TO PACKAGE EVOSUITE JARS FOR USE?
After importing evosuite modules, below launches will be found under Run --> Run Configuration --> Maven Build

For the first time when evosuite is imported to eclipse, Build with this order:
	+ evosuite clean install skip test
	+ evosuite-client build
	+ evosuite clean install skip test

During evosuite clean install skip test for the first time, it's nomral to have failures. 
When running evosuite-client build, we shouldn't skip the tests, if some tests fails, add them to evosuite/client/pom.xml to bypass.

TO GENERATE JARS WITH SOURCES, run
	+ evosuite generate jars

Evosuite jars can be found in folder evosuite/generated-jars

***** If you encounter any strange error after running maven, try to clean the project as one of these:
- refresh project.
- or Project --> Clean
- or run "evosuite clean install skip test", and then Project --> Clean, then refresh all projects.
